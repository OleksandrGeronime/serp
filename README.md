# ‚öôÔ∏è Service Event Runtime Platform (SERP)  
### A Manifest for Scalable, Maintainable Middleware Applications in C++

**SERP** is an open-source C++ framework designed to address the real-world complexity of modern middleware applications.  
It brings structure, predictability, and testability to systems built on C++, particularly in domains like automotive, robotics, and edge computing ‚Äî where stability is critical and concurrency is hard.

## üö® Problem

C++ remains a core systems language, but as systems grow, so does the cost of maintaining them:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Developers struggle with multithreading, races, and deadlocks.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Business logic becomes tangled with integration code.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Porting code between platforms leads to massive rewrites.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing and debugging time often outweighs actual development.

**SERP** addresses these challenges by abstracting concurrency, decoupling system-specific interfaces, and offering a clean structure for composable service-oriented applications.

## ‚úÖ Key Design Goals

- ‚ú≥ **Single-threaded service logic**, no need to manage synchronization
- ‚ú≥ **Thread-safe universal interfaces** for safe async communication
- ‚ú≥ **Adapters** to isolate business logic from system-specific IO (CommonAPI, FIDL, AIDL, etc.)
- ‚ú≥ **Built-in logging of all interface traffic** ‚Äî internal or external
- ‚ú≥ **CLI & WebSocket simulation interfaces**
- ‚ú≥ **Test framework for unit + integration testing**
- ‚ú≥ **Code/documentation generation from test definitions**
- ‚ú≥ **No dynamic memory, no runtime dependencies**

## üß© Core Concepts

### 1. Service Model
- Each service runs inside its own cooperative event loop.
- Code inside a service is always executed serially ‚Äî race-free by design.
- Multiple services can share threads or run in isolation.

### 2. Thread-safe Interfaces
- All APIs between services (and to external systems) follow a unified model:
  - ‚úÖ Synchronous / asynchronous methods
  - ‚úÖ Event publishing
  - ‚úÖ Attribute access
- Interfaces are declared using high-level C++ metaprogramming ‚Äî clear, compact, and declarative.
- **Every call is automatically logged**, including:
  - Arguments
  - Return values
  - Caller/callee context
  - Timing

### 3. External Integration via Adapters
- Adapters map platform protocols (e.g., SOME/IP, FIDL, AIDL) to internal thread-safe interfaces.
- This enables:
  - Portability across environments
  - Reuse of functional logic across projects
  - Robust system integration

### 4. Logging & Traceability
- All interface interactions are automatically captured:
  - Internal service calls
  - External adapter invocations
- Pluggable logging backends:
  - Console, file, system journal, DLT, or custom
- Helps with debugging, trace reconstruction, compliance, and analytics.

### 5. Test & Simulation Tools
- Lightweight test framework for:
  - Unit testing with mocks
  - Service interaction testing
  - Runtime simulation from console or WebSocket
- Future: sequence diagram ‚Üî test auto-generation

### 6. Timers, Watchdogs, Fail-fast
- Built-in priority-based timers
- Watchdogs trigger controlled crash on timeout
- Assumes supervisor will restart ‚Äî matches embedded best practices

## üõ† Build & Tooling

- **CMake** build system
- Requires **C++17**
- No runtime dependencies for core
- Optional integrations:
  - `gtest`, `gmock` for testing
  - `uWebSockets` for web simulation
  - `boost::describe` for CLI reflectivity

## üåç Industry Relevance and Public Benefit

SERP is an open-source middleware platform developed to address recurring architectural challenges in large-scale C++ systems.

Its design principles reflect years of experience in safety-critical and performance-sensitive domains such as automotive, industrial automation, and distributed embedded systems.

The project aims to:

- Reduce cost and development time through automation and standardization
- Improve system safety, testability, and diagnostic capabilities
- Promote modularity and maintainability in complex software stacks
- Lower the entry barrier for building robust C++ applications
- Contribute to the global engineering community through reusable, production-grade patterns

SERP is designed to be industry-neutral and applicable across a wide range of technical domains.
